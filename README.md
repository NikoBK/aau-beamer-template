# AAU Beamer Template (LaTeX)
Improved version of Jesper Kjær Nielsen's [AAU beamer template](https://github.com/jkjaer/aauLatexTemplates/tree/master/aauBeamer/aausimple), written in LaTex.\
If you need help setting up, using or modifying this template, I recommend checking out my [personal website's blog](https://nikolajbjoernager.dk/blog/) for relevant posts on this topic as they cover both the report and beamer.

Feel free to contact me with feedback or inquiries regarding the design and structure of this template.
