# aau-beamer-template
Improved version of Jesper Kj√¶r Nielsen's AAU beamer template, written in LaTex (https://github.com/jkjaer/aauLatexTemplates/tree/master/aauBeamer/aausimple).
This template unlike my improved report template (find the report template [here](https://github.com/NikoBK/aau-report-template)), is designed to be used by any student
attending Aalborg University. Keep in mind that the relevant field of study will have to be changed as it is preset to 'Robotics'.
